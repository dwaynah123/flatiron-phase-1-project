# Project Name: My To-Do List

My Flatiron Phase 1 Project is a single page API that you use to help make your to do list. This api will help with organzing your tasks and help you remember everything you need to do. Once you've complete all your tasks you can clear the list and make a new one. I created this API using HTML, CSS, Javascript, JSON, DOM, Developer tools, Github, and Visual Studio Code.

## How to Use

Once the page loads you should see 'Phase 1 Project' with 'My To-Do List' beneath it. Below 'My To-Do List' is a text box that has a place holder of 'input task' and labeled 'Today's Tasks'. That is where you will type in a task you need to complete then submit it to your list. Each task will then appear below the text box with a checkbox next to it. Once you complete a task you can click the checkbox next to it. Once you complete your entire to-do list you can press the clear button and start making a new one.
